.SH VERSION
This man page documents lftp version 1.0.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlftp\fR is a program that allows sophisticated ftp connection to
other hosts. If \fIhost\fR is specified then lftp will connect to that
host otherwise a connection has to be established with the open
command.
.PP
\fBlftp\fR is quite a powerful ftp client. It uses GNU readline to
read commands. It uses shell-like command syntax allowing you to
launch several commands in parallel in the background (&).
.PP
Some commands (cat, ls, site, quote) allow redirection of their output
to a file or via a pipe to external command. Commands can be started
conditionally based on termination status of previous command (&&,
||). Also, it is possible to group commands within () and execute them
in the background. All background jobs are executed in the same single
process. You can send a foreground job to the background with ^Z (C-z)
and back with the command `wait'.

.PP
When you think you are done but some background jobs are not yet finished,
you can just exit and lftp will move itself to nohup mode in
background, allowing you to use your shell or logout.
.PP
\fBlftp\fR has reliable put, reput, and mirror, along with many other
commands. 
.PP 
\fBlftp\fR does redial and reget automatically when the
connection broke and there is something to do. 

.SS Commands
.PP

.BI ! " shell command"
.PP
Launch shell or shell command.  
.PP
.Ds
!ls
.De
.PP
To do a directory listing of the local host.

.B alias
.RI " [" name " [" value ]]
.PP
Define or undefine alias \fIname\fP. If \fIvalue\fP is omitted, the alias is
undefined, else it takes the value \fIvalue\fP. If no argument is given
the current aliases are listed.
.PP
.Ds
alias dir ls -lF
alias less zmore
.De

.B anon
.PP
Sets the user to anonymous.  This is the default.

.B bookmark
.RI " [" subcommand ]
.PP
The bookmark command controls bookmarks.
.Ds
  add <name> [<loc>] - add current place or given location
                       to bookmarks and bind to given name
  del <name>         - remove bookmark with name
  list               - list bookmarks (default)
.De

.B cache
.RI " [" subcommand ]
.PP
The cache command controls local memory cache.
The following subcommands are recognized:
.TP
  stat      - print cache status (default)
.TP
  on|off    - turn on/off caching
.TP
  flush     - flush cache
.TP
  size \fIlim\fP  - set memory limit, -1 means unlimited
.TP
  expire \fINx\fP - set cache expiration time to \fIN\fP seconds (\fIx\fP=s)
         minutes (\fIx\fP=m) hours (\fIx\fP=h) or days (\fIx\fP=d)
.PP

.BR cat " [" -u ] " \fIfiles\fP"
.PP
cat outputs the remote file(s) to stdout.  (See also \fBmore\fR,
\fBzcat\fR and \fBzmore\fR)

.BI cd " rdir"
.PP
Change current remote directory.  The previous remote directory is
stored as `-'. You can do `cd -' to change the directory back.
The previous directory for each site is also stored on disk,
so you can do `open site; cd -' even after lftp restart.

.BR close " [" -a "]"
.PP
Close idle connections.  By default only with the current server, use
-a to close all idle connections.

.BR debug " [" -o " file] " level"\fR|\fP\fBoff\fP
.PP
Switch debugging to \fIlevel\fP or turn it off.  Use -o to redirect
the debug output to a file.

.BI exit " code"
.PP
exit will exit from lftp or move to background if jobs are active.  If
no jobs are active, \fIcode\fP is passed to operating system as lftp's
termination status. If \fIcode\fP is omitted, the exit code of last
command is used.

.BR get " [" -e "] [" -u "] [" -c "] \fIrfile\fP [" -o " \fIlfile\fP]"
.PP
Retrieve the remote file \fIrfile\fP and store it as the local file
\fIlfile\fP.  If -o is omitted, the file is stored to local file named as
basename of \fIrfile\fP. If the option [-c] is specified, try to reget
specified files.  You can get multiple files by specifying multiple
instances of \fIrfile\fP [and -o \fIlfile\fP]. Does not expand wildcards, use
\fBmget\fR for that.
.PP
.Ds
get README
get README -o debian.README
get README README.mirrors
get README -o debian.README README.mirrors -o debian.mirrors
.De

.B help 
[\fIcmd\fP]
.PP
Print help for \fIcmd\fP or if no \fIcmd\fP was specified print a list of
available commands.

List running jobs. -v means verbose, several -v can be specified.

.B kill
all|\fIjob_no\fP
.PP
Delete specified job with \fIjob_no\fP or all jobs.  (For \fIjob_no\fP see
.BR jobs )

.B lcd
\fIldir\fP
.PP
Change current local directory \fIldir\fP. The previous local
directory is stored as `-'. You can do `lcd -' to change the directory back.

.B ls
\fIparams\fP
.PP
List remote files. You can redirect output of this command to file or
via pipe to external command.  By default, ls output is cached, to see
new listing use 
.B rels
or 
.B "cache flush."

.BR mget " [" -c "] [" -d "] [" -e "] \fIfiles\fP"
.PP
Gets selected files with expanded wildcards.

       the files into them instead of current directory.
   -e  delete remote files after successful transfer
.De

.B mirror
.RI [ OPTS "] [" remote " [" local ]]
.PP 
Mirror specified remote directory to local directory.
.PP
.Ds 
 -c, --continue         continue a mirror job if possible
 -e, --delete           delete files not present at remote site
 -s, --allow-suid       set suid/sgid bits according to remote site
 -n, --only-newer       download only newer files (-c won't work)

 -v, --verbose          verbose operation
.De
.PP
When using -R, the first directory is local and the second is remote.
If the second directory is omitted, basename of first directory is used.
If both directories are omitted, current local and remote directories are used.
.PP
\fIRX\fP is an extended regular expression, just like in
.BR egrep (1).

.B mkdir
.RB "[" -p "] " \fIdir(s)\fP
.PP
Make remote directories. If -p is used, make all components of paths.

.B more
\fIfiles\fP
.PP
Same as `cat \fIfiles\fP | more'. if \fBPAGER\fP is set, it is used as filter.
(See also \fBcat\fR, \fBzcat\fR and \fBzmore\fR)

.B mput
.RB [ -c "] [" -d "] \fIfiles\fP
.PP
Upload files with wildcard expansion. -c means reput, -d means to
create remote directories and use the same remote name as local
one. By default it uses the basename of local name as remote one.

.B mrm
\fIfile(s)\fP
.PP
Removes specified file(s) with wildcard expansion.

.B mv
\fIfile1\fP \fIfile2\fP
.PP

List remote file names

.B open
.RB [ -e " \fIcmd\fP] [" -u " \fIuser\fP[" , "\fIpass\fP]] [" -p " \fIport\fP] \fIhost\fP|\fIurl\fP"
.PP
Select an ftp server.

.B pget
.RI [ OPTS "] " rfile " [" "\fB-o\fP lfile" ]

Gets the specified file using several connections. This can speed up
transfer, but loads the net heavily impacting other users. Use only if
you really have to transfer the file ASAP, or some other user may go
mad :) Options:

.Ds
 -n \fImaxconn\fP  set maximum number of connections (default 5)
 -u          try to recognize URLs
.De
.PP

.B put
.RB [ -c "] " \fIlfile\fP " [" -o " \fIrfile\fP]"
.PP
Upload \fIlfile\fP with remote name \fIrfile\fP. If -o omitted, the basename
of \fIlfile\fP is used as remote name. -c means reput, which requires you
to have permission to overwrite remote files in current
directory. Does not expand wildcards, use \fBmput\fR for that.

.B pwd
.PP
Print current remote directory.

.B quote
\fIcmd\fP
.PP
Send the command uninterpreted. Use with caution - it can lead to
unknown remote state and thus will cause reconnect. You cannot
be sure that any change of remote state because of quoted command
is solid - it can be reset by reconnect at any time.

.BR "reget \fIrfile\fP " [ -o " \fIlfile\fP]"
.PP
Same as `get -c'.

.B rels
[\fIargs\fP]
.PP
Same as `ls', but ignores the cache.

.B renlist
[\fIargs\fP]
.PP
Same as `nlist', but ignores the cache.

.BR reput " \fIlfile\fP [" -o " \fIrfile\fP]"
.PP
Same as `put -c'.

.B rm
\fIfiles\fP
.PP
Remove remote files.  Does not expand wildcards, use \fBmrm\fR for
that.

.B rmdir
\fIdir(s)\fP
.PP
Remove remote directories.

.B scache
[\fIsession\fP]
.PP
List cached sessions or switch to specified session.

.B set
[\fIvar\fP [\fIval\fP]]
.PP
Set variable to given value. If the value is omitted, unset the
variable.  If no argument is given, the currently set variables are
listed.

.B site
\fIsite_cmd\fP
.PP
Execute site command \fIsite_cmd\fP and output the result.
You can redirect its output.

.B source
\fIfile\fP
.PP
Execute commands recorded in file \fIfile\fP.

.B user
\fIuser\fP [\fIpass\fP]
.PP
Use specified info for remote login.

.PP
Print \fBlftp\fR version.

.B wait
\fIjobno\fP
.PP
Wait for specified job to terminate.

.B zcat

.PP
Same as cat, but filter each file through zcat. (See also \fBcat\fR,
\fBmore\fR and \fBzmore\fR)

.B zmore
\fIfiles\fP
.PP
Same as more, but filter each file through zcat. (See also \fBcat\fR,
\fBzcat\fR and \fBmore\fR)

.PP
On startup, lftp executes
.IR "~/.lftprc " and " ~/.lftp/rc" "."
You can place aliases
and `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see full protocol
debug, use `debug' to turn the debug on.
.PP
There is also a systemwide startup file in
.IR /etc/lftp.conf .
.PP
.B lftp
has the following settable variables (you can also use
`set' to see all variables and their values):
.TP
.BR cmd:csh-history \ (bool)
enables csh-like history expansion.
.TP
.BR cmd:long-running \ (seconds)
time of command execution, which is
considered as `long' and a beep is done before next prompt. 0
means off.
.TP
.BR cmd:ls-default \ (string)
default ls argument
.TP
.BR cmd:prompt \ (string)
The prompt. lftp recognizes the following backslash-escaped special
characters that are decoded as follows:

.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B \ea
an ASCII bell character (07)
.TP
.B \ee
an ASCII escape character (033)
.TP
.B \eh
the hostname you are connected to
.TP
.B \en
newline
.TP
.B \es
the name of the client (lftp)
.TP
.B \eu
the username of the user you are logged in as
.TP
.B \eU
the URL of the remote site (e.g., ftp://g437.ub.gu.se/home/james/src/lftp)
.TP
.B \ev
the version of \fBlftp\fP (e.g., 0.13.0)
.TP
.B \ew
the current working directory at the remote site
.TP
.B \eW
the basename of the current working directory at the remote site
.TP
.B \e\fInnn\fP
the character corresponding to the octal number \fInnn\fP
.TP
.B \e\e
a backslash
.TP
.B \e[
begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to
embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
.TP
.B \e]
end a sequence of non-printing characters
.PD
.RE

.TP
.BR cmd:remote-completion \ (bool)
a boolean to control whether or not lftp uses remote completion.
.TP
.BR ftp:idle \ (seconds)
disconnect from ftp server after that number of idle seconds.
.TP
.BR ftp:max-retries \ (number)
the maximum number of sequential retries of an operation without success.
.TP
.BR ftp:nop-interval \ (seconds)
delay between NOOP commands when downloading tail of a file. This is useful
for ftp servers which send "Transfer complete" message before flushing
data transfer. In such cases NOOP commands can prevent connection timeout.
.TP
.BR ftp:passive-mode \ (bool)
sets passive ftp mode. This can be useful if you are behind a firewall
or a dumb masquerading router.
.TP
.BR ftp:proxy \ (string)
specifies ftp proxy to use. The format currently is `proxy_host:port'.
To disable proxy set this to empty string. Note that it is an ftp proxy which
uses ftp protocol, not ftp over http.
.TP
.BR ftp:redial-interval \ (seconds)
sets the minimal time between reconnects.
.TP
.BR ftp:relookup-always \ (bool)
a boolean to control whether or not to lookup host address each time
before connecting. Can be useful if ftp server uses dynamic ip
address.
.TP
.BR ftp:sync-mode \ (bool)
if set lftp will send one command at a time and wait for
response. This might be useful if you are using a buggy ftp server or
router.
.TP
.BR ftp:timeout \ (seconds)
sets the network protocol timeout.
.PP
The name of variables can be abbreviated unless it becomes
ambiguous. The prefix before `:' can be omitted too. You can
set one variable several times for different closures, and thus
you can get a particular settings for particular state. The closure
is to be specified after variable name separated with slash `/'.
.P
The closure for `ftp:' domain variables is currently just the host
name as you specify it in the `open' command. For other variables it
is not currently used. See examples in the sample
.IR lftp.conf .

.B Lftp
can speed up ftp operations by sending several commands at once
and then checking all the responses. Sometimes this does not work,
thus synchronous mode is the default. You can try to turn synchronous
mode off and see if it works for you. It is known that some network
software dealing with address translation works incorrectly in the
case of several FTP commands in one network packet.

.PP
RFC959 says: ``The user-process sending another command before the
completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP
processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding
command is in progress.'' So it must be safe to send several commands
at once, which speeds up operation a lot and seems to work with all
Unix and VMS based ftp servers. Windows based servers often
cannot handle several commands in one packet.
