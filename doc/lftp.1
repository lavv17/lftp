.SH VERSION
This man page documents lftp version 3.4.1.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlftp\fR is a file transfer program that allows sophisticated ftp, http
and other connections to other hosts. If \fIsite\fR is specified then lftp
will connect to that site otherwise a connection has to be established with
the open command.
.PP
\fBlftp\fP can handle seven file access methods - ftp, ftps, http, https,
hftp, fish, sftp and file (https and ftps are only available when lftp is
compiled with openssl library). You can specify the method to use in `open
URL' command, e.g. `open http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux'. hftp is
ftp-over-http-proxy protocol. It can be used automatically instead of ftp
if ftp:proxy is set to `http://proxy[:port]'. Fish is a protocol working
over an ssh connection to a unix account. SFtp is a protocol implemented
in ssh2 as sftp subsystem.

.PP
Every operation in \fBlftp\fP is reliable, that is any not fatal error is
ignored and the operation is repeated. So if downloading breaks, it
will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if ftp server
does not support REST command, \fBlftp\fP will try to retrieve the file from
the very beginning until the file is transferred completely.

\fBlftp\fP has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several
commands in parallel in background (&). It is also possible to group
commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs
are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground
job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which
is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some
commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via
pipe to external command. Commands can be executed conditionally based
on termination status of previous command (&&, ||).
.PP
If you exit \fBlftp\fP when some jobs are not finished yet, \fBlftp\fP will move
itself to nohup mode in background. The same happens when you have a
real modem hangup or when you close an xterm.
.PP
\fBlftp\fP has builtin mirror which can download or update a whole directory
tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or
updates a directory tree on server. Mirror can also synchronize directories
between two remote servers, using FXP if available.
.PP
There is command `at' to launch a job at specified time in current
context, command `queue' to queue commands for sequential execution
for current server, and much more.
.PP
On startup, \fBlftp\fP executes \fI/etc/lftp.conf\fP and then \fI~/.lftprc\fP and
\fI~/.lftp/rc\fP. You can place aliases and `set' commands there. Some
people prefer to see full protocol debug, use `debug' to turn the
debug on. Use `debug 3' to see only greeting messages and error
messages.
.PP
\fBlftp\fP has a number of settable variables. You can use `set -a' to see
all variables and their values or `set -d' to see list of defaults.
Variable names can be abbreviated and prefix can be omitted unless the
rest becomes ambiguous.
.PP
If lftp was compiled with ssl support, then it includes software developed
by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)

.SS Commands
.PP

.BI ! " shell command"
.PP
Launch shell or shell command.
.PP
.Ds
!ls
.De
.PP
To do a directory listing of the local host.

.B alias
.RI " [" name " [" value ]]
.PP
Define or undefine alias \fIname\fP. If \fIvalue\fP is omitted, the alias is
undefined, else it takes the value \fIvalue\fP. If no argument is given
the current aliases are listed.
.PP
.Ds
alias dir ls -lF
alias less zmore
.De

.B anon
.PP
Sets the user to anonymous.  This is the default.

.BR at " \fItime\fP [ -- \fIcommand\fP ] "
.PP
Wait until the given time and execute given (optional) command. See also at(1).

.B bookmark
.RI " [" subcommand ]
.PP
The bookmark command controls bookmarks.
.Ds
add <name> [<loc>]	add current place or given location
  			to bookmarks and bind to given name
del <name>		remove bookmark with name
edit			start editor on bookmarks file
import <type>		import foreign bookmarks
list			list bookmarks (default)
.De

.B cache
.RI " [" subcommand ]
.PP
The cache command controls local memory cache.
The following subcommands are recognized:
.Ds
stat			print cache status (default)
on|off			turn on/off caching
flush			flush cache
size \fIlim\fP			set memory limit, -1 means unlimited
expire \fINx\fP		set cache expiration time to \fIN\fP seconds (\fIx\fP=s)
			minutes (\fIx\fP=m) hours (\fIx\fP=h) or days (\fIx\fP=d)
.De
.PP

.BR cat " \fIfiles\fP"
.PP
cat outputs the remote file(s) to stdout.  (See also \fBmore\fR,
\fBzcat\fR and \fBzmore\fR)

.BR cd " rdir"
.PP
Change current remote directory.  The previous remote directory is
stored as `-'. You can do `cd -' to change the directory back.
The previous directory for each site is also stored on disk,
so you can do `open site; cd -' even after lftp restart.

.BR chmod " \fImode files\fP"
.PP
Change permission mask on remote files. The mode must be an octal number.

.BR close " [" -a "]"
.PP
Close idle connections.  By default only with the current server, use
-a to close all idle connections.

.BR cls " [" OPTS "] " \fIfiles...\fP
.PP
`cls' tries to retrieve information about specified files or directories
and outputs the information according to format options. The difference between
`ls' and `cls' is that `ls' requests the server to format file listing, and
`cls' formats it itself, after retrieving all the needed information.
See `help cls' for options.

.BR command " \fIcmd args...\fP
.PP
execute given command ignoring aliases.

.BR debug " [" -o
.IR file "] "  level "|\fBoff\fP"
.PP
Switch debugging to \fIlevel\fP or turn it off.  Use -o to redirect
the debug output to a file.

.BR echo " [" -n "] \fIstring\fR"
.PP
guess what it does.

.BR exit " ["
.IR code ]
.br
.B exit bg
.PP
exit will exit from lftp or move to background if there are active jobs. If
no job is active, \fIcode\fP is passed to operating system as lftp's
termination status. If \fIcode\fP is omitted, the exit code of last
command is used.
.PP
`exit bg' forces moving to background when cmd:move-background is false.

.B fg
.PP
Alias for `wait'.

.B find
.RI " [" directory "] "
.PP
List files in the directory (current directory by default) recursively.
This can help with servers lacking ls -R support. You can redirect output
of this command.

.BR ftpcopy
.PP
Obsolete. Use one of the following instead:
.Ds
get ftp://... -o ftp://...
get -O ftp://... file1 file2...
put ftp://...
mput ftp://.../*
mget -O ftp://... ftp://.../*
.De
or other combinations to get FXP transfer (directly between two ftp servers).
lftp would fallback to plain copy (via client) if FXP transfer cannot be
initiated or ftp:use-fxp is false.

.BR get " [" -E ]
.RB [ -a "] [" -c "] [" -O
.RB "\fIbase\fP] \fIrfile\fP [" -o " \fIlfile\fP] ..."
.PP
Retrieve the remote file \fIrfile\fP and store it as the local file
\fIlfile\fP.  If -o is omitted, the file is stored to local file named as
base name of \fIrfile\fP. You can get multiple files by specifying multiple
instances of \fIrfile\fP [and -o \fIlfile\fP]. Does not expand wildcards, use
\fBmget\fR for that.

.De
.PP
When using -R, the first directory is local and the second is remote.
If the second directory is omitted, base name of first directory is used.
If both directories are omitted, current local and remote directories are used.
.PP
\fIRX\fP is an extended regular expression, just like in
.BR egrep (1).
.PP
\fIGP\fP is a glob pattern, e.g. `*.zip'.
.PP
Include and exclude options can be specified multiple times. It means that
a file or directory would be mirrored if it matches an include and does
not match to excludes after the include, or does not match anything
and the first check is exclude. Directories are matched with a slash appended.
.PP
Note that symbolic links are not created when uploading to remote server,
because ftp protocol cannot do it. To upload files the links refer
to, use `mirror -RL' command (treat symbolic links as files).
.PP
For option --newer-than you can either specify a file or time specification
like that used by at(1) command, e.g. `now-7days' or `week ago'. If you
specify a file, then modification time of that file will be used.
.PP
Verbosity level can be selected using \-\-verbose=level option or by several
\-v options, e.g. \-vvv. Levels are:
.Ds
0 - no output (default)
1 - print actions
2 - +print not deleted file names (when -e is not specified)
3 - +print directory names which are mirrored
.De
.PP
\-\-only\-newer turns off file size comparison and uploads/downloads
only newer files even if size is different. By default older files are transferred and replace newer ones.
.PP
You can mirror between two servers if you specify URLs instead of directories.
FXP is used automatically for transfers between ftp servers, if possible.
.PP
Some ftp servers hide dot-files by default (e.g. \fI.htaccess\fP), and show
them only when LIST command is used with -a option. In such case try to use
`set ftp:list-options -a'.

.B mkdir
.RB "[" -p "] " \fIdir(s)\fP
.PP
Make remote directories. If -p is used, make all components of paths.

.B module
.IR "module " [ " args " ]
.PP
Load given module using dlopen(3) function. If module name does not contain
a slash, it is searched in directories specified by module:path variable.
Arguments are passed to module_init function. See README.modules for technical
details.

.B more
\fIfiles\fP
.PP
Same as `cat \fIfiles\fP | more'. if \fBPAGER\fP is set, it is used as filter.
(See also \fBcat\fR, \fBzcat\fR and \fBzmore\fR)

.BR mput " [" -c "] [" -d "]"
.RB [ -a "] [" -E "]"
.RB [ -O " \fIbase\fP] \fIfiles\fP"
.PP
Upload files with wildcard expansion. By default it uses the base name of
local name as remote one. This can be changed by `-d' option.
.Ds
-c		continue, reput
-d		create directories the same as in file names and put the
		files into them instead of current directory
-E		delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
-a		use ascii mode (binary is the default)
-O <base>	specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed
.De

.B mrm
\fIfile(s)\fP
.PP
Same as `glob rm'. Removes specified file(s) with wildcard expansion.

.B mv
\fIfile1\fP \fIfile2\fP
.PP
Rename \fIfile1\fP to \fIfile2\fP.

.B nlist
[\fIargs\fP]
.PP
List remote file names

.B open
.RB [ -e " \fIcmd\fP]"
.BR "[" -u " \fIuser\fP[", "\fIpass\fP]]"
.BR "[" -p " \fIport\fP] \fIhost\fP|\fIurl\fP"
.PP
Select an ftp server.

.B pget
.RI [ OPTS "] " rfile " [" "\fB-o\fP lfile"
.RI ]

Gets the specified file using several connections. This can speed up
transfer, but loads the net heavily impacting other users. Use only if
you really have to transfer the file ASAP, or some other user may go
mad :) Options:
.Ds
-n	\fImaxconn\fP  set maximum number of connections (default 5)
.De
.PP

.BR put " [" -E ]
.RB [ -a "] [" -c "]"
.RB "[" -O " \fIbase\fP] \fIlfile\fP [" -o \fIrfile\fP]
.PP
Upload \fIlfile\fP with remote name \fIrfile\fP. If -o omitted, the base name
of \fIlfile\fP is used as remote name. Does not expand wildcards, use \fBmput\fR for that.
.Ds
-o <rfile>	specifies remote file name (default - basename of lfile)
-c		continue, reput
		it requires permission to overwrite remote files
-E		delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
-a		use ascii mode (binary is the default)
-O <base>	specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed
.De

.B pwd
.PP
Print current remote directory.

.B queue
.RB [ -n " \fInum\fP ] \fIcmd\fP"
.PP
Add the given command to queue for sequential execution. Each site has its own
queue. `-n' adds the command before the given item in the queue. Don't try to
queue `cd' or `lcd' commands, it may confuse lftp. Instead
do the cd/lcd before `queue' command, and it will remember the place in which
the command is to be done. It is possible to queue up an already running job
by `queue wait <jobno>', but the job will continue execution even if it is not
the first in queue.
.PP
`queue stop' will stop the queue, it will not execute any new commands,
but already running jobs will continue to run. You can use `queue stop' to
create an empty stopped queue. `queue start' will resume queue execution.
When you exit lftp, it will start all stopped queues automatically.
.PP
`queue' with no arguments will either create a stopped queue or print queue
status.

.B queue
.BR "--delete|-d " "[\fIindex or wildcard expression\fP]"
.PP
Delete one or more items from the queue. If no argument is given, the last
entry in the queue is deleted.

.B queue
.BR "--move|-m " "<\fIindex or wildcard expression\fP> [\fIindex\fP]"
.PP
Move the given items before the given queue index, or to the end if no
destination is given.
.PP
.Ds
-q	Be quiet.
-v	Be verbose.
-Q	Output in a format that can be used to re-queue.
	Useful with --delete.
.De
.PP
.Ds
> get file &
[1] get file
> queue wait 1
> queue get another_file
> cd a_directory
> queue get yet_another_file
.De
.PP
.Ds
queue -d 3		Delete the third item in the queue.
queue -m 6 4		Move the sixth item in the queue before the fourth.
queue -m "get*zip" 1	Move all commands matching "get*zip" to the beginning
			of the queue.  (The order of the items is preserved.)
queue -d "get*zip"	Delete all commands matching "get*zip".
.De

.B quote
\fIcmd\fP
.PP
For FTP - send the command uninterpreted. Use with caution - it can lead to
unknown remote state and thus will cause reconnect. You cannot
be sure that any change of remote state because of quoted command
is solid - it can be reset by reconnect at any time.
.PP
For HTTP - specific to HTTP action. Syntax: ``quote <command> [<args>]''.
Command may be ``set-cookie'' or ``post''.
.Ds
open http://www.site.net
quote set-cookie "variable=value; othervar=othervalue"
set http:post-content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
quote post /cgi-bin/script.cgi "var=value&othervar=othervalue" > local_file
.De
.PP
For FISH - send the command uninterpreted. This can be used to execute
arbitrary commands on server. The command must not take input or print ###
at new line beginning. If it does, the protocol will become out of sync.
.Ds
open fish://server
quote find -name \*.zip
.De

.BR "reget \fIrfile\fP " [ -o " \fIlfile\fP]"
.PP
Same as `get -c'.

.B rels
[\fIargs\fP]
.PP
Same as `ls', but ignores the cache.

.B renlist
[\fIargs\fP]
.PP
Same as `nlist', but ignores the cache.

.BR repeat " [\fIdelay\fP] [\fIcommand\fP]"
.PP
Repeat the command. Between the commands a delay inserted, by default 1 second.
Example:
.Ds
repeat at tomorrow -- mirror
repeat 1d mirror
.De

.BR reput " \fIlfile\fP [" -o " \fIrfile\fP]"
.PP
Same as `put -c'.

.BR rm " [" -r "] [" -f ]
\fIfiles\fP
.PP
Remove remote files.  Does not expand wildcards, use \fBmrm\fR for
that. -r is for recursive directory remove. Be careful, if something goes
wrong you can lose files. -f suppress error messages.

.B rmdir
\fIdir(s)\fP
.PP
Remove remote directories.

.B scache
[\fIsession\fP]
.PP
List cached sessions or switch to specified session.

.B set
[\fIvar\fP [\fIval\fP]]
.PP
Set variable to given value. If the value is omitted, unset the variable.

.PP
.Ds
-a	list all settings, including default values
-d	list only default values, not necessary current ones
.De
.PP

\fIsite_cmd\fP
.PP
Execute site command \fIsite_cmd\fP and output the result.
You can redirect its output.

.BR sleep " \fIinterval\fP "

can be suffixed with 'm', 'h', 'd' for minutes, hours and days respectively.
See also \fBat\fP.

.BR slot " [\fIname\fP]"
.PP
Select specified slot or list all slots allocated. A slot is a connection
to a server, somewhat like a virtual console. You can create multiple slots
connected to different servers and switch between them. You can also use
\fIslot:name\fP as a pseudo-URL evaluating to that slot location.
.PP
Default readline binding allows quick switching between slots named 0-9 using
Meta-0 - Meta-9 keys (often you can use Alt instead of Meta).

.B source
\fIfile\fP
.br
.B source -e

\fBzcat\fR and \fBmore\fR)

.SS Settings
.PP
On startup, lftp executes
.IR "~/.lftprc " and " ~/.lftp/rc" "."
You can place aliases
and `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see full protocol
debug, use `debug' to turn the debug on.
.PP
There is also a system-wide startup file in
.IR /etc/lftp.conf .
It can be in different directory, see FILES section.
.PP
.B lftp
has the following settable variables (you can also use
`set -a' to see all variables and their values):
.TP
.BR bmk:save-passwords \ (boolean)
save plain text passwords in ~/.lftp/bookmarks on `bookmark add' command.
Off by default.
.TP
.BR cmd:at-exit \ (string)
the commands in string are executed before lftp exits.
.TP
.BR cmd:csh-history \ (boolean)
enables csh-like history expansion.
.TP
.BR cmd:default-protocol \ (string)
The value is used when `open' is used
with just host name without protocol. Default is `ftp'.
.TP
.BR cmd:fail-exit \ (boolean)
if true, exit when an unconditional (without || and && at begin) command fails.
.TP
.BR cmd:long-running \ (seconds)
time of command execution, which is
considered as `long' and a beep is done before next prompt. 0

if true, lftp will fork before resolving host address. Default is true.
.TP
.BR dns:max-retries \ (number)
If zero, there is no limit on the number of times lftp will try
to lookup an address.
If > 0, lftp will try only this number of times to look up an address of each
address family in dns:order.
.TP
.BR file:charset \ (string)
local character set. It is set from current locale initially.
.TP
.BR fish:connect-program \ (string)
the program to use for connecting to remote server. It should support `-l' option
for user name, `-p' for port number. Default is `ssh -a -x'. You can set it to
`rsh', for example.
.TP

bind data socket to the interface of control connection (in passive mode).
Default is true, exception is the loopback interface.
.TP
.BR ftp:fix-pasv-address \ (boolean)
if true, lftp will try to correct address returned by server for PASV command
in case when server address is in public network and PASV returns an address
from a private network. In this case lftp would substitute server address
instead of the one returned by PASV command, port number would not be changed.
Default is true.
.TP
.BR ftp:fxp-passive-source \ (boolean)
if true, lftp will try to set up source ftp server in passive mode first,
otherwise destination one. If first attempt fails, lftp tries to set them up
the other way. If the other disposition fails too, lftp falls back to plain
copy. See also ftp:use-fxp.
.TP

for ftp servers which send "Transfer complete" message before flushing
data transfer. In such cases NOOP commands can prevent connection timeout.
.TP
.BR ftp:passive-mode \ (boolean)
sets passive ftp mode. This can be useful if you are behind a firewall or a
dumb masquerading router. In passive mode lftp uses PASV command, not the
PORT command which is used in active mode. In passive mode lftp itself
makes the data connection to the server; in active mode the server connects
to lftp for data transfer. Passive mode is the default.
.TP
.BR ftp:port-ipv4 " (ipv4 address)"
specifies an IPv4 address to send with PORT command. Default is empty which
means to send the address of local end of control connection.

requires authentication, specify user name and password in the URL.
.PP
If ftp:proxy starts with http://, hftp (ftp over http proxy) is used instead
of ftp automatically.
.TP
.BR ftp:proxy-auth-joined \ (boolean)
when true, lftp sends ``user@proxy_user@ftp.example.org'' as user name to proxy,

allow usage of REST command before LIST command. This might be useful for
large directories, but some ftp servers silently ignore REST before LIST.
.TP
.BR ftp:rest-stor \ (boolean)
if false, lftp will not try to use REST before STOR. This can be useful
for some buggy servers which corrupt (fill with zeros) the file if REST followed
by STOR is used.
.TP
.BR ftp:retry-530 \ (regex)
Retry on server reply 530 for PASS command if text matches this regular expression.
This setting should be useful to distinguish between overloaded server
(temporary condition) and incorrect password (permanent condition).

but provides privacy. Default is false. This setting is only available if
lftp was compiled with openssl.
.TP
.BR ftp:ssl-protect-fxp \ (boolean)
if true, request ssl connection for data transfer between two ftp servers
in FXP mode. CPSV or SSCN command will be used in that case. If ssl connection
fails for some reason, lftp would try unprotected FXP transfer unless
ftp:ssl-force is set for any of the two servers. Default is false.
.TP
.BR ftp:ssl-protect-list \ (boolean)
if true, request ssl connection for file list transfers. Default is true.
.TP
.BR ftp:ssl-use-ccc \ (boolean)
if true, lftp would issue CCC command after logon, thus disable
ssl protection layer on control connection.
.TP
.BR ftp:stat-interval \ (seconds)
interval between STAT commands. Default is 1.
.TP
.BR ftp:sync-mode \ (boolean)
if true, lftp will send one command at a time and wait for
response. This might be useful if you are using a buggy ftp server or
router. When it is off, lftp sends a pack of commands and waits for
responses - it speeds up operation when round trip time is significant.
Unfortunately it does not work with all ftp servers and some routers have
troubles with it, so it is on by default.
.TP
.BR ftp:timezone \ (string)
Assume this timezone for time in listings returned by LIST command.
This setting can be GMT offset [+|-]HH[:MM[:SS]] or any valid TZ value
(e.g. Europe/Moscow or MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3). The default is GMT.
Set it to an empty value to assume local timezone specified by environment
variable TZ.

.TP
.BR ftp:use-telnet-iac \ (boolean)
when true (default), lftp uses TELNET IAC command and follows TELNET protocol
as specified in RFC959. When false, it does not follow TELNET protocol and
thus does not double 255 (0xFF, 0377) character and does not prefix ABOR and
STAT commands with TELNET IP+SYNCH signal.
.TP
.BR ftp:use-quit " (boolean)"
if true, lftp sends QUIT before disconnecting from ftp server. Default is true.
.TP
.BR ftp:verify-address \ (boolean)
verify that data connection comes from the network address of control
connection peer. This can possibly prevent data connection spoofing
which can lead to data corruption. Unfortunately, this can fail
for certain ftp servers with several network interfaces,
when they do not set outgoing address on data socket, so it is disabled by default.
.TP
.BR ftp:verify-port \ (boolean)
verify that data connection has port 20 (ftp-data) on its remote end.
This can possibly prevent data connection spoofing by users of remote
host. Unfortunately, too many windows and even unix ftp servers forget
to set proper port on data connection, thus this check is off by default.

disconnect after closing data connection. This can be useful for totally
broken ftp servers. Default is false.
.TP
.BR ftps:initial-prot \ (string)
specifies initial PROT setting for FTPS connections. Should be one of: C, S,
E, P, or empty. Default is empty which means unknown, so that lftp will use

if set to off, lftp will send password as part of URL to the proxy. This
may be required for some proxies (e.g. M-soft). Default is on, and lftp
will send password as part of Authorization header.
.TP
.BR hftp:use-head \ (boolean)
if set to off, lftp will try to use `GET' instead of `HEAD' for hftp protocol.
While this is slower, it may allow lftp to work with some proxies which
don't understand or mishandle ``HEAD ftp://'' requests.
.TP
.BR hftp:use-mkcol \ (boolean)
if set to off, lftp will try to use `PUT' instead of `MKCOL' to create
directories with hftp protocol. Default is off.
.TP

Certain commands and settings take a time interval parameter. It has
the format Nx[Nx...], where N is time amount and x is time unit: d - days,
h - hours, m - minutes, s - seconds. Default unit is second. E.g. 5h30m.
Also the interval can be `infinity', `inf', `never', `forever' - it means
infinite interval. E.g. `sleep forever' or `set dns:cache-expire never'.

.SS FTP asynchronous mode (pipelining)
.PP
.B Lftp
can speed up ftp operations by sending several commands at once and
then checking all the responses. See ftp:sync-mode variable. Sometimes
this does not work, thus synchronous mode is the default. You can try
to turn synchronous mode off and see if it works for you. It is known
that some network software dealing with address translation works
incorrectly in the case of several FTP commands in one network packet.
.PP
RFC959 says: ``The user-process sending another command before the
completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP
processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding
command is in progress''. Also, RFC1123 says: ``Implementors MUST
NOT assume any correspondence between READ boundaries on the control
connection and the Telnet EOL sequences (CR LF).'' and ``a single READ
from the control connection may include more than one FTP command''.

So it must be safe to send several commands at once, which speeds up
operation a lot and seems to work with all Unix and VMS based ftp
servers. Unfortunately, windows based servers often cannot handle
several commands in one packet, and so cannot some broken routers.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Switch on debugging mode
.TP
.BI \-e " commands"
Execute given commands and don't exit.
.TP
.BI \-p " port"
Use the given port to connect
.TP
.BI \-u " user\fR[\fP\fB,\fPpass\fR]\fP"
Use the given username and password to connect
.TP
.BI \-f " script_file"
Execute commands in the file and exit
.TP
.BI \-c " commands"
Execute the given commands and exit

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are processed by \fBlftp\fR:
.IP "\fBHOME\fP"
Used for (local) tilde (`~') expansion
.IP "\fBSHELL\fP"
Used by the \fB!\fR command to determine the shell to run.
.IP "\fBPAGER\fP"
This should be the name of the pager to use.  It's used by the
\fBmore\fR and \fBzmore\fR commands.
.IP "\fBhttp_proxy\fP, \fBhttps_proxy\fP"
Used to set initial http:proxy, hftp:proxy and https:proxy variables.
.IP "\fBftp_proxy\fP"
Used to set initial ftp:proxy or hftp:proxy variables, depending
on URL protocol used in this environment variable.
.IP "\fBno_proxy\fP"
Used to set initial net:no-proxy variable.
.IP "\fBLFTP_MODULE_PATH\fP"
Used to set initial module:path variable.
.IP "\fBLFTP_HOME\fP"
Used to locate the directory that stores user-specific configuration files.  If
unset, ~/.lftp will be used.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I "/etc/lftp.conf"
system-wide startup file. Actual location depends on \-\-sysconfdir
configure option. It is \fI/etc\fR when prefix is \fI/usr\fR,
\fI/usr/local/etc\fR by default.

.TP
.I "~/.lftp/rc," "~/.lftprc"
These files are executed on lftp startup after \fI/etc/lftp.conf\fR.
.TP
.I "~/.lftp/log"
The file things are logged to when lftp moves into the background in
nohup mode.
.TP
.I "~/.lftp/bookmarks"
The file is used to store lftp's bookmarks.  See the \fBbookmark\fR
command.
.TP
.I "~/.lftp/cwd_history"
The file is used to store last working directories for each site visited.
.TP
.I "~/.netrc"
The file is consulted to get default login and password to ftp server.
Passwords are also searched here if an URL with user name but with no
password is used.
