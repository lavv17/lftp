/* Get information about a path (dir or file).  If _dir is a file, get
 * information about that file only.  If it's a directory, get information
 * about files in it.  If _showdir is true, act like ls -d: get information
 * about the directory itself.
 *
 * To find out if a path is a directory, attempt to chdir into it.  If it
 * succeeds it's a directory, otherwise it's a file (or there was an error).
 *
 * If the cache knows the file type of _dir, avoid changing directories if
 * possible, so cached listings don't touch the connection at all.
 *
 * List of cases:
 *
 * showdirs off:
 * 1. We CD into the directory.
 *    a. We get a listing.  Success.
 *    b. We fail to get a listing.  Fail.
 * 2. We fail to CD into the path. We fail to CD to the parent. Fail.
 * 3. We fail to CD into the path. We CD to the parent and fail to get a listing.
 *    Do GetInfoArray case.
 * 4. We fail to CD into the path. We CD to the parent and get a listing.
 *    a. The path we were looking for is a directory.  Fail.  (If it's a directory,
 *       we need to get its contents or nothing at all.)
 *    b. The path we were looking for is not a directory.  Success.
 *    c. The path we were looking for isn't there.  Do GetInfoArray case.
 *
 * showdirs on:
 *
 * 1. We CD to the parent and get a listing.  The path we were looking for
 *    is there.  Success.
 * 2. We CD to the parent and fail to get a listing.
 *    a. We CD to the path. (Partial success: we know it exists and is a directory.)
 *    b. We fail to CD to the path. Do GetInfoArray case.
 * 3. We fail to CD to the parent.
 *    a. We CD to the path.  The path is a directory.  Success (don't try to
 *       get more information.)
 *    b. We fail to CD to the path.  Fail.
 * 4. We CD to the parent and fail to get a listing OR
 *    We CD to the parent and the listing does not contain the path.
 *    a. We CD to the path.  The path is a directory.  Success (don't try to
 *       get more information.)
 *    b. We fail to CD to the path.  Do GetInfoArray case.
 *
 * GetInfoArray case:
 * A. We GetInfoArray in the parent, which tells us something.  We
 *    know the path exists, and is not a directory that we have access
 *    to.  Success.
 * B. We GetInfoArray in the parent, which doesn't tell us anything.
 *    We have no evidence the path exists at all. Fail.
 *
 * If we fail from something in cache, we don't know why, so turn cache off
 * and attempt to CD into the path to get an error message.
 *
 * All of these cases can operate out of cache, so be sure to test both, as
 * the code flow is often different.  (GetInfoArray never operates out of cache.)
