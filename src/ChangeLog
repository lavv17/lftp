2001-10-29  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* misc.cc: use dynamic allocation in set_tz; use unsetenv to unset TZ;
	  implement unsetenv is not available using environ array.
	* ColumnOutput.cc: make it compile with irix compiler.

2001-10-27  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* FtpDirList.cc: clean up; style.
	* FileCopy.cc: style; restore eof behaviour.
	* misc.cc: rewrite mem_crlf and crlf_to_lf to make them more clear.

2001-10-27  Glenn Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* FileCopy.cc, FtpDirList.cc, FtpDirList.h, misc.cc, misc.h:
	  Speed up ascii mode transfer.
	* command.cc: cosmetics.

2001-10-25  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* misc.cc, misc.h: (mktime_from_tz) new function.
	* FtpListInfo.cc, FtpListInfo.h: use it.
	* resource.cc: (ftp:timezone) new setting.

2001-10-25  Glenn Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* FileSetOutput.cc, FileSetOutput.h, commands.cc: -1 option for cls;
	  readded -q to help cls; added missing \n.
	* misc.cc, misc.h: -rwxr-xr-t implies S_IXOTH; -rwxr-xr-T does not;
	  mktime_from_utc has a problem when isdst is -1; the returned time is
	  off by an hour if the local timezone is in DST.
	* FtpListInfo.cc: assume unix server's timezone to be GMT.

2001-10-25  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* CmdExec.cc, FileAccess.h, FileCopyFtp.cc, FileSetOutput.cc, Fish.cc,
	  GetJob.cc, Http.cc, NetAccess.cc, ResMgr.h, Resolver.cc,
	  Speedometer.cc, StatusLine.cc, commands.cc, ftpclass.cc, ftpclass.h,
	  lftp.cc: (QueryBool) new functions, now lftp should compile with
	  a compiler without bool type.
	* Fish.cc: check line length before comparing with yes/no/password;
	  remove extra xfree(home), fortunately home was null at that point.

2001-10-22  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* complete.cc: fix local tilde completion.
	* Fish.cc, resource.cc: add fish:shell setting.
	* SMTask.cc, misc.cc: include time.h first.
	* Makefile.am: distribute convert-netscape-cookies.

2001-10-19  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* commands.cc: fix typo in cls help. Reported by Nicolas Noble.
	* complete.cc: restore prompt and clear message on SIGINT.

2001-10-17  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* ftpclass.cc, ftpclass.h: workaround for WarFTPD ABOR glitch.
	* CopyJob.cc, CopyJob.h, FileCopy.cc, FileCopy.h: NoStatusOnWrite added.
	* commands.cc: use it.
	* FileSetOutput.cc, FileSetOutput.h: fix recls.
	* misc.cc: (xasprinf) fix va_end argument.
	* complete.cc: make readline define correct rl_message prototype.
	* FileSetOutput.cc: make it output precise date too.

2001-10-16  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* misc.cc: use int to avoid warning.

2001-10-15  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* ColumnOutput.cc: use xfree.
	* FileAccess.h: add comment about ListInfo::GetResult.
	* FileSetOutput.cc: fix memory leaks; use xfree.
	* commands.cc: cosmetics.

2001-10-15  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* misc.cc, misc.h: conding style; safety precautions (better checking
	  on vsnprintf return value); just double buffer size; include stdarg.h
	  in misc.h.

2001-10-15  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* ColumnOutput.cc, ColumnOutput.h, FileSetOutput.cc, misc.h, misc.cc:

	Column output now treats width properly (using mbswidth().)

	Date output added to cls -l; uses locale-dependant date (like ls does.)

	Added xasprintf and xvasprintf.  (Trivial asprintf/vasprintf
	implementation so we don't need to deal with trio just for those.)

	Added some ColumnOutput support for date output (addf()).

	* PtyShell.cc: fix warnings.
	* Fish.cc: improve status.

2001-10-12  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* url.cc: optimize user/password extraction using strrchr.

2001-10-12  Jonas Jensen <bones@huleboer.dk>

	* url.cc: allow @ in password.

2001-10-12  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* Fish.cc, Fish.h: use PtyShell; answer ssh questions about (yes/no)
	  and password.
	* StatusLine.cc: (Show) check timer even if newstr is equal to to_be_shown.
	* PtyShell.cc, PtyShell.h, lftp_pty.cc, lftp_pty.h: new files.
	* ArgV.h: (Add) alias to Append.
	* complete.cc: add > to remote completion status.
	* ftpclass.cc: don't add ./ to CWD in extreme case when PWD is not
	  absolute.
	* misc.cc: (dir_file) don't return NULL if possible.
	* Time.cc, Time.h: (ms) fixed integer overflow.

2001-10-10  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* StatusLine.cc, StatusLine.h, Time.cc, Time.h, complete.cc:

	added ms constructor for time; this gives us a free cast from int to
	Time, which means all of the ms operations can away (they're implicit.)

	Defined negative time values more clearly (in comments).  This usually
	doesn't matter.

	Fixed Time.h indentation.

2001-10-10  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* FileSet.cc: (LocalFile) don't set name if already set. This fixes
	  LocalAccess' ListInfo and mirror.
	* PollVec.cc: treat AddTimeout(negative) as AddTimeout(0).

2001-10-09  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* ftpclass.cc, ftpclass.h, FileAccess.cc: more home_auto fixes;
	  SameLocationAs returns true even if o->home is null.

2001-10-09  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* Time.cc, Time.h, commands.cc, complete.cc, StatusLine.cc, StatusLine.h,
	misc.cc, misc.h:

	Time and Timer classes in Time.{cc,h}.  Implemented only a
	couple operators; add others as required.  This can probably be fairly
	widely-used; I didn't implement it anywhere else, though.  It doesn't
	cast to anything; that just causes problems.

	Disabled short help for: rels renlist reget reput

	added references: [re]ls, [re]nlist, [re]get, [re]cls, [re]put
	Help is down to 23 lines (from 25.)  How about changing help to use
	ColumnOutput?  That might cut it down further.  (Due to the length of
	some short help, it might not, though--not on an 80x25, anyway.)

	Updated [c]ls help; it was too long.

	(xgettimeofday) new function. (cmd:status-interval) new setting.

2001-10-08  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* commands.cc: fix site command broken by ls changes.
	* FileAccess.h, FileAccess.cc, Http.cc, Http.h, ftpclass.cc, ftpclass.h:
	  NetAccess.cc, NetAccess.h: new method ResetLocationData; reset
	  home_auto on Connect/Login/AnonymousLogin.
	* FileAccess.h, Fish.cc, ftpclass.cc, ftpclass.h: (FA::set_home) new
	  method; use it; (Ftp::PropagateHomeAuto) new method; use it; fixed
	  bug with unsynced home's.

2001-10-08  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* ColumnOutput.cc, commands.cc, complete.cc, complete.h, lftp_rl.c:

	Reupdated my address.

	Add cls, recls and rels to list of remote-completers.

	Make local completion mimic remote completion by forming a FileSet.
	This simplifies completion, gets rid of ignore_non_dirs (which was
	causing some really obscure problems with completion adding one too
	many slashes--didn't track this down since ignore_non_dirs isn't used
	anymore) and gives us color (etc) for local completion.  I didn't
	actually delete ignore_non_dirs yet.

	Add status feedback for remote completion, in the message area.  If -q
	is given in cls_completion_default, this is disabled.  (This is also
	undocumented and slightly different from the effect -q is intended to
	have--but doesn't, since it's currently disabled--but it seems the most
	appropriate place to put this, since cls_completion_default honors just
	about every cls option; and even if status displaying was currently
	working for cls, job status wouldn't be appropriate for completion
	since it'd mangle the line.)  I'll hold off on documenting this until -q
	is fixed for cls (unless it turns out that it just can't reasonably be done,
	but I'm optimistic.)

	Keep glob_res around after completion until the next completion or the
	next command; this lets us use it to do our own completion result
	display.

	Handle our own completion results; this also gives us optimized column
	widths for all completions, not just filenames.

	Fixed color reset bug.

	Glitch: we don't honor the user's completion-ignore-case readline
	setting.  We can't get access to it portably.  It's not too big a deal;
	adding -i to cls-completion-default has the same effect, and honoring
	both of them would probably be a little confusing anyway.

2001-10-05  Alexander V. Lukyanov <lav@yars.free.net>

	* ColumnOutput.cc: fix memory leak; change \e to \\e.
	* FileSetOutput.cc: fix coredump when LS_COLORS is unset.
	* misc.h: add comment on Subst.
	* lftp.cc: set top_exec to zero after deletion, this fixes a coredump
	  at exit.
	* commands.cc: remove bzcat, bzmore and cls from command index,
	  it has become too long for 25 linear display.

2001-10-05  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* CmdExec.cc, ColumnOutput.cc, ColumnOutput.h, FileSet.cc, FileSet.h,
	FileSetOutput.cc, FileSetOutput.h, Filter.cc, Filter.h, Makefile.am,
	ResMgr.cc, ResMgr.h, commands.cc, misc.cc, misc.h:

	ColumnOutput.{cc,h}: column display, originally from FileUtils.  I've
	cleaned it up substantially, generalized color support, class-ized it
	and some other stuff.

	Moved FDStream::width() to misc.cc; nuked isatty().

	tokenize() bugfixes.

	Added TriBoolValidate; Bool with a third ("Auto").  Feel free to think
	of a better name.

	Don't give ls's job a blank name; results in unsightly empty `' in
	status.

	Add sorting to FileSets.  A second array of pointers (aliasing the main
	list) is created when the list is sorted; the list can't be modified if
	the list is sorted (so we don't have to keep track of how the list is
	sorted.)  Multiple-level sorting is possible (sort by name then
	directories-first, for example.)  This method doesn't have to touch much
	of FileSet and keeps the binary-search-insert intact.  (If needed, it
	could be made to allow adds after sorting by simply dumping new entries
	on the end of the sorted list, so new entries aren't sorted.)

	FileSet::operator[] uses the sorted list, if available.

	FindByName uses FindGEIndByName, making that function O(log n) rather
	than O(n).

	A bunch of static, very cut-and-paste code from FileUtils.cc for parsing
	LS_COLORS.

	FileSetPrint class.

2001-10-03  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* ArgV.cc, ArgV.h, CmdExec.cc, DummyProto.cc, DummyProto.h,
	FileAccess.cc, FileAccess.h, FileSet.cc, FileSet.h, Filter.cc,
	Filter.h, Http.cc, LocalAccess.cc, QueueFeeder.cc, StatusLine.cc,
	keyvalue.cc, keyvalue.h, misc.cc, misc.h:

	New ArgV constructor, to take a string and tokenize it.
	misc.cc code to do the real work.  (This could possibly be improved
	to make it usable for the main tokenizer.)

	misc.cc code to do \x, etc. substitution, and code elsewhere to use
	this.  (This would have been the third time this could would have been
	duplicated, so I merged it.)

	DummyNoProto for MakeListInfo, same as MakeDirList.

	Option for Glob to ignore case.

	isatty() and width() for FDStream.  (isatty() could be done away with,
	as it doesn't really save any code being a 1-liner; width() is more
	functional.)

	Move make-FileInfo-from-local-file into FileInfo::LocalFile().

	Dumb QueueFeeder bugfix (of my own bug, of course.)

	Made a bunch of KeyValue functions const.  (Not completely correctly:
	when returning a member value like those do, there really should be both
	a const and non-const version ...)

2001-10-02  Aaron Schrab <aaron@schrab.com>

	* Fish.cc, Http.cc, log.cc: move va_end so that it is called always.

2001-08-27  Glenn F. Maynard <g_ld@zewt.org>

	* FileSet.cc, FileSet.h, FileAccess.h, CmdExec.cc: remove the FileSet
	  sort stuff.  It's superfluous now.

	* resource.cc: some more patterns for retry-530.

2001-05-15  Alexander V. Lukyanov  <lav@yars.free.net>

	* resource.cc: new settings ftp:retry-530 and ftp:retry-530-anonymous.
	  This settings should be useful to distinguish between overloaded
	  server (temporary condition) and incorrect password (permanent
	  condition).
	* ftpclass.cc: retry on server reply 530 for PASS command if text
	  matches above regular expressions. Retry ftp login quickly on next
	  address if the server has many (works well on ftp.redhat.com, for
	  example).
	* ResMgr.cc, ResMgr.h: improved fuzzy variable name matching. Exact
	  prefix and exact name after prefix are taken into account separately.
	  E.g. http:pro is not ambigous now between http:proxy and https:proxy.

	* resource.cc: don't use user name in anon-pass (suggested by
