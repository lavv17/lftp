* new settings xfer:eta-period and xfer:rate-period for calculation of eta
  and current rate.

  ABOR command but closes data connection immediately.

  reconnect-interval renamed to reconnect-interval-base. It is possible to
  use short names recon-int-b, recon-int-mul, recon-int-max.

  rather use it instead of previously received.
